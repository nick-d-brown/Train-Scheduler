### 1-Description :page\_facing\_up:

The Train-Scheduler is a web application that will take inputs for a train's name, destination, first arrival, and frequency, and will output them with a "Minutes Until" calculation and a "Next Arrival" time displayed on a row. It is meant to be a helpful tool for commuters looking to keep their train schedules in order.

This application utilizes JavaScript and jQuery for the logic and DOM manipulation in addition to Google's Firebase that acts as a backend database. Moment.js was used for the time calculations for the "Minutes Until" and "Next Arrival" sections. Twitter Bootstrap was used for the design as a means of fast and clean styling.

### 3-Challenges :scream::boom:

> **Note:** This section is meant for beginners an idea of what the *crux* technology was for this project. Ideally by seeing this first they will be able tackle the hard problem first to start the learning/absorption process as soon as possible.

The biggest challenge with this project was understanding and utilizing Firebase. I had the opportunity to learn the proper way to add data to and receive data from a database, in this case Firebase. I found that in general the concepts were easy to grasp. The largest roadblock was in learning the proper syntax and placement of the code used to communicate with Firebase. This can be expected when picking up any new technology. Fortunately, Google has extensive documentation on Firebase. Though it can be dense and difficult to digest at times, the documentation definitely will help the understanding of this tool. I did also find the Moment.js library slightly difficult to use at times, but as with Firebase it too became more understandable after looking at the docs on their website several times. My advice would be start early. Use the links listed below to learn more about the technology and remember **you will eventually learn how everything works!**
