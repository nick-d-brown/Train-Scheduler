# Train-Scheduler
The Train-Scheduler is a web application that will take inputs for a train's name, destination, first arrival, and frequency, and will outout them with a "Minutes Until" calculation and a "Next Arrival" time displayed on a row. It is meant to be a helpful tool for commuters looking to keep their train schedules in order.

-Technologies

--This application utilizes Javascript and jQuery for the logic and DOM manipulation in addition to Google's Firebase that acts as a backend database. Moment.js was used for the time calculations for the "Minutes Until" and "Next Arrival" sections. Twitter Bootstrap was used for the design as a means of fast and clean styling.

-Challenges

--The biggest challenge with this project was understanding and utilizing Firebase. I had the opportunity to learn the propper way to push and get information into this simple implimentation of Firebase, and I found that in general the concepts were easy to grasp. The largest roadblock was in learning the proper syntax and placement of the code used to communicate with Firebase.
